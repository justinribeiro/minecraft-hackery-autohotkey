Minecraft Hackery Autohotkey
=============
Minecraft hotkeys and UI for OP /give in SMP in AutoHotKey

## What is this?
An Autohotkey script that shortcuts commands in game.

## Where's the image?
The item id image was not created by me and must downloaded from Marvin @ marvk.net.

## Mappings

 * From Desi’s Remaps: F1 toggles hold-left-click. Handy for breaking lots of blocks or mining obsidian.
 * From Desi’s Remaps: F2 toggles hold-W, making you move forward automatically. Use with F1 for automated mining action!
 * JDR: F3 toggles hold-s, making you move backward automatically.
 * JDR: F4 prompts for itemid, for use as OP in SMP: make sure to set player var
 * JDR: Ctrl-R toggles crouching.
